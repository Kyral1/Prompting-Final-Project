      "        Thanks for sharing that. Feeling down at 15 is common—there’s a lot going on: school pressure, friendships, family dynamics, changing bodies, and big questions about the future. Many teens experience mood changes, stress, or sadness at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, your feelings matter, and it’s important to pay attention to how long this has been going on and how intense it feels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider these questions:\n",
      "- How long have you been feeling this way? (Days/weeks vs. most days for weeks)\n",
      "- Is it affecting sleep, appetite, motivation, grades, or relationships?\n",
      "- Do you still enjoy things you used to?\n",
      "- Are you feeling hopeless, numb, or withdrawing a lot?\n",
      "\n",
      "What you can do now:\n",
      "- Talk to someone you trust: a parent/guardian, school counselor, teacher, coach, or another adult. You don’t have to explain everything perfectly—just start with “I haven’t been feeling like myself.”\n",
      "- Try small routines: regular sleep, getting outside daily, moving your body, eating regularly, and staying connected with a friend.\n",
      "- Write it out: journaling or rating your mood each day can help you see patterns and triggers.\n",
      "- Limit doom-scrolling and set gentle boundaries with social media.\n",
      "\n",
      "When to get extra support:\n",
      "- If the feelings last most days for more than two weeks\n",
      "- If it’s hard to function day-to-day\n",
      "- If you’re experiencing panic attacks, self-harm, or thoughts of hurting yourself\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re thinking about self-harm or feel unsafe:\n",
      "- You’re not alone, and help is available right now.\n",

      "        I’m really glad you said that. Feeling like hope is slipping can be scary and heavy—and it’s something many people go through. Yes, these feelings can pass, and they often do with support and time. But when it feels harder every day, that’s a sign to reach out sooner rather than later so you don’t have to carry this alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few things that can help right now:\n",
      "- Tell someone you trust today: a parent/guardian, school counselor, favorite teacher, coach, relative, or a close friend. You can say, “I’ve been feeling less hopeful lately and I need some support.”\n",
      "- Make a small plan for today: one tiny task (shower, homework chunk, short walk), one connection (text or call a friend), one comfort (music, show, pet, journaling), and one basic need (drink water, eat something, try to sleep at a regular time).\n",
      "- Reduce “all-or-nothing” thinking: When your brain says “it’s always going to be like this,” try “Right now it feels awful, and feelings can change.”\n",
      "- Track it for a week: quick 1–10 mood rating each day and note sleep, stress, or triggers. This helps you and a trusted adult or counselor see patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting more support:\n",
      "- A school counselor, pediatrician, or a mental health professional can help you figure out what’s going on and give you tools that work. Many teens feel relief after just a few sessions.\n",
      "- If talking in person feels hard, consider text/chat helplines where you can be anonymous and go at your own pace.\n",

      "If you’re feeling unsafe or thinking about hurting yourself:\n",

      "- Stay safe online: If any of this is happening on social media, block, mute, and report. Don’t engage in back-and-forth.\n",
