      "        I’m really glad you reached out. Feeling down at 15 is very common—there’s a lot changing in life, school, friendships, family, and your body. Most people your age go through periods of low mood. That said, your feelings matter, and you deserve support.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few questions to help understand what you’re experiencing:\n",
      "- How long have you been feeling this way?\n",
      "- Is it most days, or does it come and go?\n",
      "- Has it been hard to enjoy things you used to like?\n",
      "- How are your sleep, energy, appetite, and concentration?\n",

      "- Keep a routine: regular sleep, meals, schoolwork, and time for breaks.\n",
      "- Move your body: even a short walk or stretch can lift mood.\n",
      "- Do small enjoyable activities: music, drawing, gaming with a friend, reading—whatever usually feels okay.\n",
      "- Limit endless scrolling late at night and get outside if you can.\n",
      "- Write it out: journaling can help get thoughts out of your head.\n",

      "- Do one small, doable thing daily that used to feel okay (music, drawing, texting a friend, a game). Tiny wins matter when hope is low.\n",
      "- Limit late-night scrolling and try for consistent sleep—poor sleep can make everything feel heavier.\n",

      "- Tell a trusted adult directly: Parent/guardian, school counselor, teacher, or coach. Be specific: who, where, when, what you’ve seen or heard, and why you feel someone might come for you. Ask them to help you make a safety plan at school (safe places to go, who to check in with, and how to report concerns).\n",

      "        That sounds really stressful, and I’m sorry you’re going through it. I can’t know for sure what they’re saying, but I get why it feels like it’s about you when they go quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few things you can do:\n",
      "- Reality-check gently: Notice specific evidence. Are there comments, gestures, or actions aimed at you, or could it be coincidence? Writing down what happens (date, time, place, who, what was said/done) can help you see patterns clearly.\n",
      "- Ask a neutral question if it feels safe: “Hey, did I interrupt something?” or “Everything okay?” Their reaction can give you clues and sometimes resets the dynamic.\n",
      "- Get an outside view: Ask a trusted friend or classmate what they’ve noticed. Sometimes others can confirm if there’s a problem—or reassure you if it’s not about you.\n",
      "- Loop in an adult: A counselor, teacher, or coach can discreetly keep an eye on things and intervene if needed. You don’t have to handle this alone.\n",
      "- Protect your space: Stick with friends, choose seats near supportive people, and limit engagement with anyone who tries to provoke you.\n",
      "- Take care of your stress: Feeling watched can spike anxiety. Grounding techniques (slow breathing, focusing on what you can see/hear/feel) and talking it out with someone you trust can help.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re seeing clear signs of targeting—whispering followed by laughing at you, sharing rumors, blocking your path, online posts about you—treat it as bullying and report it to your school counselor or administrator with your notes/screenshots.\n",

      "\n",
      "A few steps you can take today:\n",
      "- Get to safer spaces: Stay with friends or near adults at school. Sit near the front of class or by exits. Walk with people between classes and after school.\n",
      "- Tell a specific adult directly: “I’m scared someone is going to hurt me. I need help staying safe.” Ask for concrete support (hall pass escorts, changing seats, someone to check in, route changes).\n",
      "- Write down details: Times, places, names, what you saw/heard, any messages or posts. Screenshots if online. This helps adults take it seriously and act.\n",
      "- Ask for a safety plan: Your school counselor/administrator can help set things like safe routes, a buddy, supervised areas, and who to report to immediately if something happens.\n",
      "- Involve home: Tell a parent/guardian exactly how scared you feel and what you want—rides, pick-up spot changes, meeting with the school, checking messages.\n",
      "- Get another perspective: If you have one friend or teacher you trust, ask them to watch with you for a day and report what they notice.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Check in with yourself: Is there something specific that happened (a rumor, a post, a recent conflict) that might explain the looks? Sometimes identifying a cause helps you decide what to do next.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Talk to someone you trust: A parent/guardian, school counselor, teacher, or coach can help you figure out what’s going on and how to handle it. You don’t have to deal with this alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Keep a simple log: Note dates, times, places, and what happened (who, what they did or said). This helps if you decide to report it and can make patterns clearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Set boundaries calmly: If you feel safe, you could say something brief like, “Is there a reason you’re staring?” or “That makes me uncomfortable.” Keep it neutral and don’t escalate.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Stay with friends: Move between classes, lunch, or after school with people you trust. It can make you feel safer and discourage unwanted attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Manage online angles: If this could be connected to social media, review privacy settings, limit who can view your posts, and consider muting/blocking anyone who’s bothering you.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Involve school staff if it continues: Strange looks can be annoying, but if it starts to feel like stalking, bullying, following you, recording you, or interfering with your school day, report it to a counselor, administrator, or trusted teacher right away. They can monitor, intervene, and keep an eye on any specific students.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Trust your instincts and prioritize safety: If you ever feel unsafe—someone follows you, corners you, or threatens you—go to a safe place (office, library, crowded area) and contact an adult immediately.\n",

      "A few things to keep in mind:\n",
      "- There are many possible reasons for the whispering that aren’t about you (private jokes, personal topics, classwork, or even planning something unrelated). Our brains often fill in gaps with the most threatening story, especially when we’re already on edge.\n",
      "- It’s possible they’re being unkind—but it’s also possible it’s not about you. The best way to know is to get more information in a safe, low‑drama way.\n",

      "What you can do:\n",
      "- Reality-check with someone you trust: A friend in that group, a classmate who’s around when it happens, or a trusted adult can give you an outside perspective.\n",
      "- Try a calm, direct check-in with one person: If it feels safe, pick someone approachable from the group and ask privately, “Hey, I’ve noticed people get quiet when I walk in. Did I do something?” Keep it simple and non-accusatory.\n",
      "- Stay near supportive people: Sit with friends, move between classes with someone you trust, and limit time around groups that make you uneasy.\n",
      "- Note patterns: When and where does it happen? Is it always the same people? Do they do anything beyond whispering (comments, following, filming)? If it crosses into bullying or harassment, report it.\n",
      "- Involve school staff if needed: If this is affecting your ability to focus, or you feel targeted, talk to a counselor, teacher, or administrator. You deserve a school environment where you feel safe.\n",

      "- Bring specifics if you have them: names, times, places, screenshots, what you’ve noticed. If you don’t have specifics, it’s still okay to say you’re scared and need help.\n",
      "- Ask an adult to advocate for you: A parent/guardian, coach, or school social worker can help push for action even if others brushed it off before.\n",

      "- Protect your online space: If you’re on social media, check privacy settings and be careful about what you post and who can see it.\n",
      "- Document patterns: If it keeps happening, write down dates, times, places, and who was involved. This helps adults take action if it escalates.\n",
      "- Use school support: Schools usually have anti-bullying policies. Report it to a counselor, dean, or administrator if it continues or makes you feel unsafe.\n",
