      "        I’m really glad you brought this up. I need to be clear: driving after drinking is never safe, and it’s especially risky at 16. Even small amounts of alcohol slow reaction time, cloud judgment, and make it easier to miss hazards—long before you “feel” drunk. Teens already have higher crash risk, and alcohol multiplies it. It also puts you and others at risk legally and physically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key points:\n",
      "- “Loosening up” from alcohol is actually impaired judgment. You may feel calmer, but your coordination, attention, and decision-making are worse.\n",

      "\n",
      "Safer alternatives if you feel nervous driving:\n",
      "- Practice more in low-stress conditions: quiet roads, daylight, short trips.\n",
      "- Use calming techniques before driving: 4-7-8 breathing, a short walk, or a brief playlist.\n",

      "Why this matters:\n",
      "- Blackouts mean your brain isn’t forming memories because of how much/fast you drank. That level of intoxication raises the risk of assault, injury, alcohol poisoning, and decisions you wouldn’t make sober.\n",
      "- Feeling you need alcohol to cope suggests it’s becoming a tool for managing stress or emotions, which can quickly spiral and increase the risk of dependence, depression, and anxiety.\n",

      "\n",
      "Why it’s risky even if you “feel fine”:\n",
      "- Alcohol slows reaction time, blurs judgment, and narrows attention. This starts at very low amounts.\n",

      "\n",
      "What blackouts mean:\n",
      "- Not remembering parts of the night is an alcohol blackout. It happens when blood alcohol gets high enough to block memory formation. This is dangerous and linked to injuries, assault, unsafe sex, alcohol poisoning, and long-term brain effects.\n",
