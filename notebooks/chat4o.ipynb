Hormonal changes, school stress, friendships, family dynamics, and even just figuring out who you are can all contribute to feeling low at times.\n",

      "### 1. **Consider Other Possibilities**\n",
      "   - People talking quietly when you enter a room might not necessarily mean they are plotting against you. They could be talking about something unrelated, or they might stop talking because they’re shy or feel awkward.\n",

      "\n",
      "### 2. **Don’t Assume the Worst**\n",
      "   - It’s easy to interpret other people’s actions in a negative way, especially if you’re already feeling uncomfortable. Try to give them the benefit of the doubt unless you have clear evidence that they’re doing something harmful.\n",

      "\n",
      "### 5. **Focus on Yourself**\n",
