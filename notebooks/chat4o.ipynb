      "        First of all, I'm really sorry to hear you're feeling down. It's important to know that you're not alone, and many teens experience similar feelings. Being 15 can be a challenging time because you're going through a lot of changes—physically, emotionally, and socially. It's normal to feel overwhelmed or down sometimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, if these feelings are lasting a long time, feel very intense, or are interfering with your daily life (like school, friendships, or hobbies), it might be a sign that you could use some extra support. Talking to someone you trust, like a parent, teacher, school counselor, or a mental health professional, can really help. They can provide guidance and help you figure out what's going on.\n",

      "        I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. It can be so tough to carry those heavy emotions, especially when it feels like there's no clear way out. The truth is, feelings like this can and often do pass, but when you're in the middle of them, it can feel like they never will. It's important to remember that you're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help you through this.\n",

You don't have to face this by yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s also okay to take small steps to care for yourself. Doing little things like getting outside, journaling your thoughts, listening to music, or talking to a friend can sometimes help lighten the weight, even just a little.

These feelings are serious, and they deserve attention. It's important to talk to someone you trust—whether that's a parent, teacher, school counselor, or another adult who can help you.
