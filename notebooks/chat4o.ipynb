      "        Feeling down or experiencing periods of sadness is a normal part of life, especially during your teenage years. At 15, you're going through a lot of changes physically, emotionally, and socially, which can sometimes feel overwhelming. Here are a few things to consider:\n",

      "3. **Self-Reflection**: At your age, you're discovering more about who you are and where you fit in the world. This can sometimes lead to feelings of uncertainty or self-doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, if you're feeling down most of the time, or if it's affecting your ability to enjoy life, focus on school, or interact with others, it might be a good idea to talk to someone you trust about it.
