      "\n",
      "**As a new driver,** your skills aren't as automatic as experienced drivers', so impairment affects you even more. Teens are already at higher crash risk - alcohol multiplies that dramatically.\n",

      "**Legally:** A DUI at 16 could mean losing your license, criminal charges, difficulty getting into college, and massive insurance costs. Many places have zero-tolerance laws for underage drivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The \"loosening up\" part:** If you feel you need alcohol to handle driving, that's actually anxiety - and alcohol makes you *worse* at driving while making you *feel* more confident. That's a deadly combination.\n",
