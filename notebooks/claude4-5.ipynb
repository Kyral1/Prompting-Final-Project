      "**The facts:**\n",
      "- Alcohol impairs your driving ability *even when you feel fine* - it affects reaction time, judgment, and coordination\n",
      "- Teen drivers already have higher crash risks due to inexperience; adding alcohol multiplies that danger significantly\n",

      "- This can affect college admissions, jobs, and your future\n",
      "\n",

      "- You could kill or seriously injure yourself, your passengers, or innocent people\n",
      "- This is how tragedies happen - not to \"other people,\" but to regular teens who thought they were okay\n",
      "\n",
      "**What to do instead:**\n",
      "- If you need to drive: don't drink, period\n",
      "- If you've been drinking: get a ride from a sober friend, call a parent (even if you'll get in trouble), use Uber/Lyft, or stay where you are\n",
      "- Many parents have \"no questions asked\" pickup policies because they'd rather you be safe\n",
